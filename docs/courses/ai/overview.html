        <h1>Definition and Scope of AI</h1>
      </div>
      <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human
        intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like
        humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits
        associated with a human mind such as learning, problem-solving,
        perception, and language understanding.
      </p>
      <div class="key-concept">
        <h3>Key Definition</h3>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence is the branch of computer science concerned
          with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that
          typically require human intelligence.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956, defines it as "the science
        and engineering of making intelligent machines." This definition
        emphasizes the engineering aspect of creating systems that can operate
        in ways we would consider "intelligent" if a human were to perform the
        same actions.
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        "AI is the study of how to make computers do things which, at the
        moment, people do better." — Rich & Knight
      </div>
      <h2>The Scope of AI</h2>
      <p>
        The field of AI encompasses a wide range of technologies, approaches,
        and applications. Its scope has expanded dramatically since its
        inception, particularly with recent advancements in computing power,
        data availability, and algorithm development.
      </p>
      <h3>Major Areas Within AI</h3>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence covers several specialized domains:</p>

      <h2>Categorizing AI Systems</h2>
      <p>
        AI systems can be categorized in several ways, but two of the most
        common distinctions are:
      </p>
      <h3>1. Weak AI vs. Strong AI</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Weak AI</strong> (also called Narrow AI) refers to systems
        designed and trained for a specific task. These systems don't possess
        general intelligence or consciousness but can perform their designated
        tasks at or above human levels of performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Strong AI</strong> (also called Artificial General Intelligence
        or AGI) refers to systems with generalized human cognitive abilities.
        When presented with an unfamiliar task, a strong AI system could find a
        solution without human intervention. This remains largely theoretical at
        present.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Examples of Weak AI in Daily Life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)</li>
          <li>Email spam filters</li>
          <li>Netflix and Spotify recommendation systems</li>
          <li>Weather prediction software</li>
          <li>Autonomous features in modern vehicles</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>2. Based on Functionality</h3>
      <p>
        Another way to categorize AI systems is based on their capabilities and
        how they compare to human intelligence:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Reactive Machines:</strong> Basic AI systems that react to
          current scenarios without memory of past events or ability to plan
          future actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited Memory:</strong> AI systems that can use past
          experiences to inform future decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Theory of Mind:</strong> AI systems that understand human
          emotions, beliefs, and thought processes (largely theoretical).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-Aware AI:</strong> Systems with consciousness and
          self-awareness (entirely theoretical).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout">
        <h3>Historical Perspective</h3>
        <p>
          The concept of artificial intelligence dates back to ancient history
          with myths of artificial beings. However, AI as a formal academic
          discipline began in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, where the term
          "artificial intelligence" was first adopted.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>The Current AI Landscape</h2>
      <p>
        Today's AI landscape is dominated by machine learning, particularly deep
        learning approaches. These systems excel at pattern recognition tasks
        and have revolutionized fields like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Language translation and processing</li>
        <li>Image and speech recognition</li>
        <li>Game playing (Chess, Go, video games)</li>
        <li>Medical diagnosis</li>
        <li>Financial analysis and prediction</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While impressive, current AI systems remain examples of narrow AI,
        excelling in specific domains but lacking the general intelligence that
        characterizes human thinking.
      </p>
      <div class="key-concept">
        <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p>
          AI is not a single technology but a broad field encompassing numerous
          approaches to creating machines that can perform tasks requiring
          intelligence. Its definition and scope continue to evolve as new
          breakthroughs emerge and our understanding of both human and machine
          intelligence deepens.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          How would you define AI in your own words based on what you've
          learned?
        </li>
        <li>What examples of AI do you interact with in your daily life?</li>
        <li>
          Why is the distinction between narrow AI and general AI important?
        </li>
        <li>
          What ethical considerations might arise from the development of
          increasingly capable AI systems?
        </li>
