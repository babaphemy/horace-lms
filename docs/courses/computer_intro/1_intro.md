## 🧩 **Module 1: Introduction to Programming & Logical Thinking**

**Goal:** Build foundational understanding of programming concepts through real-life analogies, creative expression, and hands-on activities.

**Duration:** 1 week  
**Total Lessons:** 4  
**Tools Needed:** Whiteboard/marker, printed worksheets, pencils, Scratch (optional), cards/paper strips for sequencing

---

### 📘 **Lesson 1: What is Programming?**

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understand programming as giving instructions to a computer.
- Identify real-world examples of algorithms.

**Activities:**

- Class discussion: What do computers need to follow commands?
- Example: Giving instructions to a classmate to walk from one spot to another.
- Video or illustration: “How computers think”

---

### 📘 **Lesson 2: Daily Algorithms Around Us**

**Learning Objectives:**

- Recognize simple step-by-step procedures (algorithms) in everyday life.
- Learn about sequencing.

**Activities:**

- Group challenge: Write step-by-step instructions for brushing your teeth or making a cup of tea.
- Game: “Robot Walk” – students give step commands to make the teacher move like a robot.

---

### 📘 **Lesson 3: The Language of Logic**

**Learning Objectives:**

- Introduce logical thinking with “if–then” decisions.
- Understand how computers process instructions conditionally.

**Activities:**

- Interactive worksheet on “if this… then that” scenarios (e.g., If it rains, then take an umbrella).
- Mini dramatization game: Students act out scenarios based on logic cards.

---

### 📘 **Lesson 4: Workbook, Quiz & Hands-On Assessment**

**Learning Objectives:**

- Reinforce and assess comprehension.
- Apply logical thinking in simplified programming-like tasks.

---

#### 📄 Workbook Activities:

1. **Match the Algorithm:** Pair daily activities to the correct sequence.
2. **Unjumble the Instructions:** Rearranged steps to complete a task (e.g., tying shoelaces).
3. **If–Then Puzzle:** Complete logic puzzles (e.g., If the sun is out, then I wear \_\_\_).

#### 📋 Hands-On Assessment:

- Students are given physical instruction cards and asked to organize them to guide a robot (classmate or cutout) from start to finish on a simple maze drawn on the classroom floor.

#### 🧠 Quiz (10 marks):

1. What is programming?
2. Give one example of an algorithm from daily life.
3. What does “sequence” mean in programming?
4. What will happen if we skip a step in an algorithm?
5. Write a simple if–then statement (e.g., If I’m tired, then I \_\_\_).

Would you like me to continue with **Module 2**, which could introduce **block-based programming using Scratch or Blockly**? Or would you prefer a **version that doesn’t rely on devices** for schools with limited infrastructure? I can tailor it either way. 🎓✨
