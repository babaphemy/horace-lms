# The PMP Mindset

- Always discuss, investigate, analyze, and ask questions before deciding on a solution.
- Never settle for delays or extra costs. However, extra costs take precedence over delays.
- Be a servant leader: encourage, care, nurture, listen, and avoid creating friction within the team.
- Value is paramount.
- Use root cause analysis and MVPs or demos as key tools.
- For predictive projects, any change must go through a change request process. For agile projects, there is no formal change request process.
- Your team members are the experts—make every decision with them.
- The project manager makes decisions and handles issues. Only escalate to the sponsor as a last resort, typically for budget problems.
- Everyone involved, directly or indirectly, is a stakeholder and should be included in the stakeholder register, along with their impact on the project.
- Regardless of whether the project is completed or terminated, the closing phase must occur in predictive projects.
- In predictive projects, the plan is your map—refer to it constantly.
- Predictive project keywords: change control board (CCB), change control process.
- Agile project keywords: sprint, iteration, scrum, daily standup, backlog, Kanban, product increment, product owner/manager.
- When the team is unsure, consult a subject matter expert (SME) or refer to the lessons learned register from past projects.
- When transitioning from predictive to agile, introduce agile concepts gradually (e.g., pilot project, inception deck).
- Agile projects are self-organizing; teams are in charge, but the project manager can step in to manage and resolve conflicts.
- Agile projects require consistent feedback from the customer.
- Never immediately reject a request or opportunity, especially from a client.
