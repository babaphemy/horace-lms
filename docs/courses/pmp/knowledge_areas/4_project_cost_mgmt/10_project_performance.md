## 🎯 **Lesson: Mastering Earned Value Management (EVM)**

Earned Value Management integrates **scope**, **schedule**, and **cost** to assess **project performance** and **forecast future performance**.

---

## 🧠 **Key Terms & Formulas**

### 1️⃣ **Earned Value (EV)**

**Formula:** `EV = % Complete × BAC`

- **EV** represents the value of work actually completed.
- **BAC** = Budget at Completion = total planned budget for the entire project.

📌 **Example:**
If BAC = \$100,000 and you’ve completed 30%,
→ `EV = 0.30 × $100,000 = $30,000`

---

### 2️⃣ **Actual Cost (AC)**

- Cost **incurred** so far, regardless of progress.

📌 **Example:**
If you’ve spent \$35,000 so far,
→ `AC = $35,000`

---

### 3️⃣ **Planned Value (PV)**

**Formula:** `PV = Planned % Complete × BAC`

- What you **should have completed** by this point in time.

📌 **Example:**
If the plan says you should be 40% done by now,
→ `PV = 0.40 × $100,000 = $40,000`

---

### 4️⃣ **Cost Variance (CV)**

**Formula:** `CV = EV - AC`

- Positive = under budget
- Negative = over budget

📌 **Example:**
`CV = $30,000 - $35,000 = -$5,000` → **Over budget**

---

### 5️⃣ **Schedule Variance (SV)**

**Formula:** `SV = EV - PV`

- Positive = ahead of schedule
- Negative = behind schedule

📌 **Example:**
`SV = $30,000 - $40,000 = -$10,000` → **Behind schedule**

---

### 6️⃣ **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**

**Formula:** `CPI = EV / AC`

- Measures **cost efficiency**
- CPI > 1 = Good; CPI < 1 = Bad

📌 **Example:**
`CPI = $30,000 / $35,000 ≈ 0.857` → **Cost overrun**

---

### 7️⃣ **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**

**Formula:** `SPI = EV / PV`

- Measures **schedule efficiency**
- SPI > 1 = Ahead; SPI < 1 = Behind

📌 **Example:**
`SPI = $30,000 / $40,000 = 0.75` → **Schedule delay**

---

### 8️⃣ **Estimate at Completion (EAC)**

**Formula:** `EAC = BAC / CPI`

- Forecasted total cost based on current efficiency

📌 **Example:**
`EAC = $100,000 / 0.857 ≈ $116,700` → **Over budget forecast**

---

### 9️⃣ **Estimate to Complete (ETC)**

**Formula:** `ETC = EAC - AC`

- How much more it will **cost** to finish

📌 **Example:**
`ETC = $116,700 - $35,000 = $81,700`

---

### 🔟 **Current Cost Performance**

**Formula:** `AC + (BAC - EV)`

- Another way to compute EAC
- Assumes remaining work is done as originally planned

📌 **Example:**
`= $35,000 + ($100,000 - $30,000) = $105,000`

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ **To-Complete Performance Index (TCPI)**

Used to determine how efficiently you must use resources to meet a target.

#### a) **To meet BAC:**

**Formula:** `TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)`

- Tells you the required **future CPI** to meet the **original budget**.

📌 **Example:**
`= ($100,000 - $30,000) / ($100,000 - $35,000) = $70,000 / $65,000 ≈ 1.08`
→ You need to be **more efficient** than you’ve been so far.

#### b) **To meet EAC:**

**Formula:** `TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)`

- Required performance to achieve **revised cost target**

---

## 💡 **Can You Meet BAC or EAC?**

- If your current **CPI < 1**, and **TCPI to meet BAC > 1.1**, then it is **unrealistic** to meet BAC → EAC becomes a more realistic target.
- If **TCPI to meet EAC is ≤ 1**, then it’s **achievable**.

---

## 🧪 PMP-Style Scenario Summary:

Let's say:

- BAC = \$100,000
- % Complete = 30%
- EV = \$30,000
- AC = \$35,000
- PV = \$40,000

Then:

| Metric             | Value     |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| CV = EV - AC       | -\$5,000  |
| SV = EV - PV       | -\$10,000 |
| CPI = EV / AC      | 0.857     |
| SPI = EV / PV      | 0.75      |
| EAC = BAC / CPI    | \$116,700 |
| ETC = EAC - AC     | \$81,700  |
| TCPI (to meet BAC) | 1.08      |
| TCPI (to meet EAC) | \~0.85    |

## 🎓 **What to Remember for the PMP Exam**

- Memorize these **core formulas**
- Know **what each metric tells you**
- Watch out for **signs**: negative = bad; CPI/SPI < 1 = problem
- TCPI > 1 = hard to achieve; TCPI < 1 = easier

### Worksheet

**PMP Earned Value Management (EVM) Formula Sheet**

---

### 1. Key Terms and Formulas

**BAC (Budget at Completion)**

- Total planned budget for the project

**EV (Earned Value)**

- Formula: `EV = % Complete × BAC`
- Example: 30% of \$100,000 = \$30,000

**AC (Actual Cost)**

- Total cost incurred so far

**PV (Planned Value)**

- Formula: `PV = Planned % Complete × BAC`
- Example: 40% of \$100,000 = \$40,000

---

### 2. Variances

**Cost Variance (CV)**

- Formula: `CV = EV - AC`
- Interpretation: Positive = Under budget, Negative = Over budget

**Schedule Variance (SV)**

- Formula: `SV = EV - PV`
- Interpretation: Positive = Ahead of schedule, Negative = Behind schedule

---

### 3. Performance Indices

**Cost Performance Index (CPI)**

- Formula: `CPI = EV / AC`
- Interpretation: CPI > 1 = Good, < 1 = Over budget

**Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**

- Formula: `SPI = EV / PV`
- Interpretation: SPI > 1 = Ahead, < 1 = Behind

---

### 4. Forecasting

**Estimate at Completion (EAC)**

- Formula: `EAC = BAC / CPI`
- Meaning: Expected total cost based on current performance

**Estimate to Complete (ETC)**

- Formula: `ETC = EAC - AC`
- Meaning: Additional cost required to finish the project

**Current Cost Forecast**

- Formula: `AC + (BAC - EV)`
- Meaning: EAC assuming future performance is per original plan

---

### 5. To-Complete Performance Index (TCPI)

**a) To meet BAC**

- Formula: `TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)`
- Interpretation: Effort needed to stay within original budget

**b) To meet EAC**

- Formula: `TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)`
- Interpretation: Effort needed to meet revised budget

---

### 6. What the Metrics Mean

- **CPI < 1** and **TCPI > 1.1** → Unlikely to meet BAC
- **CPI < 1** and **TCPI (EAC) ≤ 1** → EAC is more realistic

---
