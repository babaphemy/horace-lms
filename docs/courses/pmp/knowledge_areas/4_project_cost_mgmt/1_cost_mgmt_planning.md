### **Project Cost Management in PMP**

**Project Cost Management** is the process of **planning, estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs** to ensure a project is completed **within its approved financial limits**. It helps teams optimize spending and prevent budget overruns.

### **Key Processes in Project Cost Management**

| **Process**         | **Purpose**                              | **Example Use Case**                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost Estimating** | Predict financial requirements for tasks | "Developing API backend may cost $5,000."             |
| **Cost Budgeting**  | Allocate funds for project phases        | "Total infrastructure budget is $50,000."             |
| **Cost Control**    | Track expenses & prevent overruns        | "Monitoring AWS hosting costs to stay within budget." |

ðŸ”¹ **Goal:** Ensure all project costs align with business expectations and stakeholder requirements.

### **Cost Estimation Techniques**

| **Method**                        | **How It Works**                                        | **Best Use Case**                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Analogous Estimating**          | Uses past project cost data for estimates               | Quick budgeting                       |
| **Parametric Estimating**         | Applies mathematical models for cost predictions        | Large-scale or repetitive projects    |
| **Bottom-Up Estimating**          | Builds estimates from individual activity costs         | Detailed, resource-intensive projects |
| **Three-Point Estimating (PERT)** | Calculates cost range (Optimistic, Likely, Pessimistic) | High-risk projects with uncertainties |

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** If UI development previously cost **$10,000**, a new project with **similar scope** might be estimated using **Analogous Estimating**.

### **Cost Control Methods**

âœ… **Earned Value Management (EVM)** â€“ Measures budget efficiency using **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**.  
âœ… **Variance Analysis** â€“ Compares actual vs. planned cost trends to identify overruns.  
âœ… **Trend Forecasting** â€“ Predicts future costs based on historical project spending.  
âœ… **Change Control Process** â€“ Ensures cost modifications follow approval workflows.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** If actual spending exceeds projected costs by **15%**, **variance analysis** helps identify the **cause and corrective action**.
