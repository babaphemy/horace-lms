### **Analogous Estimating in Project Management**

**Analogous Estimating** is a **top-down estimation technique** that uses **historical data** from past projects to predict the **time, cost, or resource requirements** for a current project. It is **quick** and **effective for early-stage planning**, but it may be **less accurate** than detailed estimation methods.

### **How Analogous Estimating Works**

1️⃣ **Identify a Similar Past Project** – Select a project with comparable scope, complexity, and industry relevance.  
2️⃣ **Extract Key Estimates** – Review durations, costs, or resource usage from historical data.  
3️⃣ **Apply Adjustments** – Modify estimates based on **differences** in scope, technology, or team capabilities.  
4️⃣ **Document Assumptions** – Clearly outline the reasoning behind the estimate to ensure transparency.

📌 **Example: Using Analogous Estimating for Web Application Deployment**

🔹 A past **e-commerce website development** took **6 months** with similar requirements.  
🔹 The new project has **slightly fewer features**, so the estimate is adjusted to **5 months**.  
🔹 This estimate helps **plan resources early** without needing detailed task-level breakdowns.

### **Advantages & Limitations of Analogous Estimating**

| **Advantages**                             | **Limitations**                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Fast estimation method                  | ❌ Less precise than data-driven models   |
| ✅ Useful for early-stage project planning | ❌ Relies on past project accuracy        |
| ✅ Requires minimal data collection        | ❌ Cannot account for unique complexities |

🔹 **Best Used When:**  
✔ Early in project initiation when details are **unclear**  
✔ A **similar past project** is available for reference  
✔ High-level estimates are **sufficient** for decision-making
