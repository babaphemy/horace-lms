### **Three-Point Cost Estimating in Project Management**

**Three-Point Cost Estimating** is a technique used to calculate **realistic cost estimates** by considering **uncertainty and risk factors**. It provides a **balanced forecast** by incorporating three different cost scenarios:

✅ **Optimistic Cost (O)** → Best-case scenario where everything proceeds smoothly.  
✅ **Most Likely Cost (M)** → Expected cost based on standard conditions.  
✅ **Pessimistic Cost (P)** → Worst-case scenario, accounting for risks or delays.

---

### **Formula for Three-Point Cost Estimating (PERT Method)**

📌 Expected Cost (E) is calculated using the **Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)** formula:

```plaintext
Expected Cost = (Optimistic + 4 × Most Likely + Pessimistic) ÷ 6
```

🔹 **This formula prioritizes the Most Likely estimate**, making the calculation more realistic.

---

### **Example: Three-Point Cost Estimating for Infrastructure Deployment**

📌 **Task:** Setting up cloud servers for deployment

- **Optimistic Cost:** **$8,000** (if all resources are available & discounts apply)
- **Most Likely Cost:** **$10,000** (standard pricing & workload)
- **Pessimistic Cost:** **$14,000** (unexpected costs, delays, or security issues)

📌 **Using PERT Formula:**

```plaintext
Expected Cost = (8,000 + 4 × 10,000 + 14,000) ÷ 6
               = (8,000 + 40,000 + 14,000) ÷ 6
               = 62,000 ÷ 6
               = **$10,333**
```

✅ The **expected cost estimate** for cloud infrastructure deployment is **$10,333**.

### **Advantages & Limitations of Three-Point Estimating**

| **Advantages**                                  | **Limitations**                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Improves accuracy by considering variability | ❌ Requires historical data for realistic predictions |
| ✅ Helps identify risk factors before budgeting | ❌ More complex than single-point estimates           |
| ✅ Balances best-case and worst-case scenarios  | ❌ Relies on expert judgment for probabilities        |

🔹 **Best Used When:**  
✔ Projects **involve uncertainty or risk factors** that impact costs.  
✔ The project has **historical data** to support optimistic & pessimistic estimates.  
✔ Teams need **a structured approach to forecasting** budget fluctuations.
