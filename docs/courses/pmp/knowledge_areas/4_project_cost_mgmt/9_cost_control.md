### **Objectives of Cost Control**

✅ **Track Actual vs. Budgeted Costs** – Ensuring spending aligns with forecasts.  
✅ **Identify Cost Variances** – Detecting overspending early to take corrective action.  
✅ **Optimize Resource Allocation** – Adjusting labor, materials, and expenses efficiently.  
✅ **Prevent Scope Creep** – Ensuring only approved changes impact the budget.  
✅ **Ensure Stakeholder Transparency** – Providing financial reports on budget health.

### **Cost Control Techniques**

| **Technique**                     | **Purpose**                                             | **Example Use Case**                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Earned Value Management (EVM)** | Measures cost performance and efficiency                | Evaluating CPI (Cost Performance Index) for deviations |
| **Variance Analysis**             | Identifies differences between planned vs. actual costs | Detecting overspending in cloud server costs           |
| **Cost Forecasting**              | Predicts future expenditures based on trends            | Estimating additional funding needs for maintenance    |
| **Change Control Process**        | Ensures budget adjustments follow approval workflows    | Managing unexpected security updates                   |

📌 **Example:**  
🚀 If **API development** is budgeted at **$4,000**, but actual spending reaches **$4,800**, **variance analysis** detects a **cost overrun of 20%**, requiring adjustments to maintain budget stability.

### **Steps to Implement Cost Control**

1️⃣ **Establish Cost Baseline** – Define the approved budget, excluding management reserves.  
2️⃣ **Monitor Actual Spending** – Track project expenses regularly.  
3️⃣ **Analyze Cost Variances** – Identify where actual costs deviate from planned figures.  
4️⃣ **Apply Corrective Actions** – Use budget optimization techniques like **scope adjustment or resource reallocation**.  
5️⃣ **Report to Stakeholders** – Ensure transparency through **budget status updates**.

🔹 **Key Metric in Cost Control:**

```plaintext
Cost Performance Index (CPI) = Earned Value (EV) ÷ Actual Cost (AC)
```

✔ **CPI > 1:** Budget is **efficiently managed**  
❌ **CPI < 1:** Cost overruns are **impacting project finances**
