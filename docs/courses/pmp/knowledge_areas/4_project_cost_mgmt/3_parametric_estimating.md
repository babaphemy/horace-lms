### **Parametric Estimating in Project Management**

**Parametric Estimating** is a **data-driven estimation technique** that uses **mathematical models** to predict **costs, durations, and resource requirements** based on historical data and measurable variables. It is **more accurate** than Analogous Estimating, especially for repetitive tasks.

### **How Parametric Estimating Works**

📌 **Formula-Based Approach:**

- Uses **historical data** and **quantifiable variables** to calculate estimates.
- Works by **multiplying known unit rates** (e.g., cost per hour, time per module) by project scope.
- Adjusts **complexity factors** based on variations from past projects.

📌 **Example:**  
🔹 **Web Application Testing Estimation**

- Each module requires **5 hours** of testing.
- The project has **20 modules** → Total estimated testing time = **5 × 20 = 100 hours**.

📌 **Infrastructure Deployment Example:**

- **$50 per server setup** → Deploying **100 servers** → Estimated Cost = **$50 × 100 = $5,000**.

### **Advantages & Limitations of Parametric Estimating**

| **Advantages**                               | **Limitations**                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Higher accuracy than Analogous Estimating | ❌ Requires reliable historical data             |
| ✅ Scales well for large projects            | ❌ Doesn't account for unpredictable risks       |
| ✅ Works best for repetitive tasks           | ❌ Limited flexibility for unique project scopes |

🔹 **Best Used When:**  
✔ There is **historical performance data** for similar tasks.  
✔ The work involves **repetitive, scalable activities** (e.g., coding, manufacturing).  
✔ Detailed cost and duration tracking are required **for budgeting precision**.

### **Comparison: Parametric vs. Analogous Estimating**

| **Aspect**   | **Parametric Estimating**                        | **Analogous Estimating**                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Approach** | Uses mathematical models                         | Uses historical project comparisons      |
| **Accuracy** | Higher (data-driven)                             | Lower (generalized)                      |
| **Best for** | Repetitive tasks with measurable parameters      | Quick estimates when details are unclear |
| **Requires** | Detailed past project data & cost/time variables | Similar past project reference           |
