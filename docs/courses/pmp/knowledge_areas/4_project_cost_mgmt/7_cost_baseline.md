### **Cost Baseline in Project Cost Management**

The **Cost Baseline** is the **approved project budget**, excluding management reserves, used to measure **actual project performance** against planned expenditures. It is established after cost estimation and budgeting and serves as a **reference point for tracking financial performance**.

### **Key Aspects of Cost Baseline**

âœ… **Sets Financial Expectations** â€“ Defines expected spending across project phases.  
âœ… **Supports Performance Measurement** â€“ Used for tracking cost variances in **Earned Value Management (EVM)**.  
âœ… **Guides Funding Allocation** â€“ Ensures financial resources are distributed efficiently.  
âœ… **Enables Forecasting** â€“ Helps predict future budget trends and adjustments.

ðŸ“Œ **Formula for Cost Baseline:**

```plaintext
Cost Baseline = Sum of Approved Budgeted Costs (Excluding Management Reserves)
```

ðŸ”¹ **Management reserves are NOT included** â€“ they cover unforeseen risks beyond planned scope.

| **Indirect Costs**       | Overhead expenses supporting project execution     | Office space, utilities           |
| **Contingency Reserves** | Funds set aside for known risks                    | Extra budget for potential rework |
| **Work Package Costs**   | Estimated cost per task in WBS                     | UI design cost estimate           |

ðŸ“Œ **Example: Cost Baseline Breakdown for a Web Development Project**

| **Phase**                     | **Estimated Budget ($)** | **Contingency Reserve ($)** | **Total Cost Baseline ($)** |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Design & Prototyping**      | $10,000                  | $2,000                      | $12,000                     |
| **Development & Integration** | $25,000                  | $5,000                      | $30,000                     |
| **Testing & Security**        | $12,000                  | $3,000                      | $15,000                     |
| **Deployment & Maintenance**  | $8,000                   | $2,000                      | $10,000                     |
| **Total Project Baseline**    | **$55,000**              | **$12,000**                 | **$67,000**                 |

ðŸ”¹ The **total cost baseline ($67,000)** is used to **track project financial performance**.
