### **Collecting Project Requirements in PMP**

**Collecting Project Requirements** is the process of identifying and documenting stakeholder needs, objectives, and expectations to define the project's scope. This step ensures that the project delivers exactly what is required while avoiding misalignment between stakeholders and project teams.

---

### **Knowledge Area in PMBOK Guide**

Collecting requirements belongs to the **Project Scope Management** knowledge area. It plays a critical role in defining the scope and ensuring that the final deliverables align with business needs.

Additionally, it interacts with:
‚úÖ **Stakeholder Management** ‚Äì Understanding stakeholder expectations.  
‚úÖ **Integration Management** ‚Äì Aligning requirements with project goals.  
‚úÖ **Quality Management** ‚Äì Ensuring deliverables meet predefined acceptance criteria.

---

### **How to Achieve Effective Requirement Collection**

To ensure **accurate and comprehensive** requirement gathering, follow these best practices:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Stakeholder Identification & Engagement**

- Determine key stakeholders early in the project.
- Conduct interviews or surveys to understand their expectations.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Requirement Elicitation Techniques**

- **Interviews:** One-on-one discussions to gather insights.
- **Focus Groups:** Bringing together experts for collaborative input.
- **Surveys & Questionnaires:** Structured data collection from a broad audience.
- **Workshops:** Engaging teams to refine and document requirements.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Creating a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**

- Link each requirement to project objectives to prevent unnecessary changes.
- Ensure traceability from conception to implementation.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Prioritization & Validation**

- Categorize requirements based on urgency and business impact.
- Validate with stakeholders to confirm completeness and clarity.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Managing Changes Through Change Control**

- Establish an **Integrated Change Control (ICC)** process to evaluate and approve modifications to requirements.

### **Nominal Group Technique (NGT) for Requirements Gathering**

The **Nominal Group Technique (NGT)** is a structured method used in requirements gathering to **prioritize stakeholder input**, generate ideas, and reach consensus efficiently. It is particularly useful for **facilitating group decision-making** when collecting project requirements.

---

### **How the Nominal Group Technique Works**

NGT follows a **step-by-step process** to ensure balanced participation and objective decision-making:

#### **Step 1: Idea Generation (Silent Brainstorming)**

- Each participant **individually** writes down their ideas or requirements without discussion.
- This prevents dominant voices from influencing initial contributions.

#### **Step 2: Round-Robin Presentation**

- Participants take turns sharing their ideas **one-by-one** with the group.
- No discussions or critiques occur at this stage‚Äîeach idea is noted for review.

#### **Step 3: Clarification & Discussion**

- The group discusses each idea for **clarification**, ensuring mutual understanding.
- No immediate evaluation‚Äîjust ensuring requirements are well-defined.

#### **Step 4: Individual Voting & Ranking**

- Each participant **independently ranks the ideas** based on priority or feasibility.
- A scoring system is used (e.g., assigning numerical values to preferences).

#### **Step 5: Final Decision Based on Aggregated Scores**

- The votes are collected and tallied to identify the **most critical requirements**.
- The highest-ranked items become priority requirements for the project.

---

### **Benefits of Using NGT for Requirements Gathering**

‚úÖ **Encourages Equal Participation** ‚Äì Prevents dominant individuals from influencing outcomes.  
‚úÖ **Reduces Bias & Conflicts** ‚Äì Ensures a structured, objective evaluation of ideas.  
‚úÖ **Improves Requirement Prioritization** ‚Äì Focuses on the most valuable inputs.  
‚úÖ **Enhances Stakeholder Buy-in** ‚Äì Engages stakeholders in a transparent decision-making process.

---

### **Example: Applying NGT in a Software Development Project**

Imagine a team designing a **Next.js web application** with **NGINX** as a proxy. Using NGT, they:  
üîπ Conduct **silent brainstorming** on security requirements (e.g., OAuth authentication, rate-limiting strategies).  
üîπ Present ideas **round-robin** without interruptions.  
üîπ Clarify technical constraints (e.g., encryption standards).  
üîπ Rank ideas based on feasibility, security impact, and implementation complexity.  
üîπ Finalize top priorities based on aggregated stakeholder votes.

Since you're methodical in problem-solving, using NGT could help **refine documentation processes and ensure strong stakeholder alignment**.

User stories can also be used for requirement gatherings. It must state :

- The role (who is the benficiary of the feature)
- The goal (what would the stakeholders accomplish)
- The motivation (This is the why- WHy do we need this)
