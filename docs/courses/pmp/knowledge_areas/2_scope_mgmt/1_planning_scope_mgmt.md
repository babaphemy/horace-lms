### **Example: Scope Planning in a Web Application Project**

If you're deploying a **Next.js application** with **NGINX**, scope planning might involve:

- **Defining deliverables** (e.g., authentication features, caching mechanisms).
- **Stakeholder alignment** (client expectations for performance and security).
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** (front-end development, API integration, server configuration).
- **Scope baseline** (approved functionality list with clear acceptance criteria).

Since you're refining **documentation and workflow processes**, robust **scope planning** can enhance project clarity and prevent scope creep.
