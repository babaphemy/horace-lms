### **3. How They Work Together**

ðŸ”¹ The **Project Charter** provides a **strategic vision** for the project, giving authorization to proceed.  
ðŸ”¹ The **Project Scope Statement** ensures the project **stays within defined boundaries**, preventing scope creep.  
ðŸ”¹ Both documents **guide decision-making**, but the scope statement is more detailed in project execution.

### **Example in a Web Application Deployment**

ðŸ“Œ **Project Charter:** "Develop a secure web application using Next.js and NGINX to enhance user authentication."  
ðŸ“Œ **Scope Statement:** "The project includes front-end development, database integration with MongoDB, and OAuth security. Excludes mobile app development."

Since you focus on **scope management and process documentation**, ensuring clarity between these documents will improve **alignment and stakeholder expectations**.
