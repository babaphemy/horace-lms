### **Pareto Chart, Histogram, Scatter Chart & Run Chart in Quality Management**

These **visual tools** help teams analyze **patterns, trends, and relationships** in data to improve quality control and decision-making.

---

### **1️⃣ Pareto Chart (80/20 Rule Analysis)**

Just another bar chart
🔹 Uses **bar graphs** to show which defects or issues need **urgent focus**.  
🔹 Helps apply the **Pareto Principle**—fixing **20% of problems** often resolves **80% of issues**.

📌 **Example:**  
✔ In software development, tracking **bug categories** helps prioritize fixes.

---

### **2️⃣ Histogram (Frequency Distribution Chart)**

Just another bar chart
🔹 Displays **data distribution** across categories in a **bar format**.  
🔹 Helps identify **patterns in defect occurrences**.

📌 **Example:**  
✔ Tracking **response time variations** on a website to detect **performance bottlenecks**.

---

### **3️⃣ Scatter Chart (Correlation Analysis)**

shows relationship between 2 variables. Measures correlation

🔹 Plots data points to analyze **relationships between two variables**.  
🔹 Helps determine if **one factor influences another** (positive, negative, or no correlation).

📌 **Example:**  
✔ Studying whether **higher code complexity leads to more defects**.

---

### **4️⃣ Run Chart (Time Series Analysis)**

🔹 Displays **data trends over time** to monitor stability or fluctuations.  
🔹 Helps teams **predict future variations** in performance.

📌 **Example:**  
✔ Tracking **customer complaints per month** to analyze service quality trends.

### **Why These Charts Matter in Project Management**

✅ **Pareto Charts** prioritize **high-impact quality fixes**.  
✅ **Histograms** reveal **defect distribution patterns**.  
✅ **Scatter Charts** determine **cause-effect relationships**.  
✅ **Run Charts** track **process stability over time**.
