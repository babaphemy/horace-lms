### **Framework for Implementing Design for X (DFX) in Agile Workflows**

Integrating **Design for X (DFX) principles** within Agile workflows ensures efficient product development while optimizing specific attributes like **cost, reliability, maintainability, and sustainability**. Below is a structured framework for applying **DFX in Agile projects**.

---

### **1️⃣ Identify Key Design for X (DFX) Objectives**

✔ Define the primary **DFX focus areas** based on **project requirements and stakeholder priorities**.  
✔ Select relevant **DFX principles** (e.g., **Design for Manufacturing, Design for Cost, Design for Reliability**).  
✔ Align DFX objectives with **Agile sprint goals and product backlog items**.

📌 **Example:** In a web development project, prioritize **Design for Performance** by setting benchmarks for **page load time and responsiveness**.

---

### **2️⃣ Integrate DFX into Agile Backlog & Sprint Planning**

✔ Incorporate **DFX-related tasks** into sprint planning sessions.  
✔ Define **Acceptance Criteria** based on DFX principles to ensure quality deliverables.  
✔ Assign **DFX responsibilities** to cross-functional team members.
