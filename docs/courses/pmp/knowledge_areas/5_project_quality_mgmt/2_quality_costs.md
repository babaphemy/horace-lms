### **Quality Costs in PMP**

---

### **1️⃣ Prevention (QA) Costs** – **Avoiding defects before they occur**

✅ **Training programs** for teams  
✅ **Process standardization** (e.g., Agile quality frameworks)  
✅ **Quality planning & audits**  
✅ **Investing in better tools and materials**

📌 **Example:** Setting up **automated testing** in software development to prevent coding errors.

### **2️⃣ Appraisal(Quality Control) Costs** – **Inspecting and verifying quality**

✅ **Testing & inspection of deliverables**  
✅ **Quality audits** and peer reviews  
✅ **Equipment for performance analysis**

📌 **Example:** Running **usability tests** before launching a new application.

### **3️⃣ Internal Failure(Negative Outcome) Costs** – **Fixing defects before delivery**

✅ **Rework costs** (fixing faulty products before shipment)  
✅ **Scrap & material wastage**  
✅ **Downtime costs** due to defects

📌 **Example:** Debugging code errors before a software release **delays deployment** and increases costs.

---

### **4️⃣ External Failure(Negative outcome) Costs** – **Fixing defects after delivery**

✅ **Customer complaints & warranty claims**  
✅ **Refunds & product replacements**  
✅ **Loss of reputation due to poor quality**

📌 **Example:** A defective **hardware product recall** costing millions in lost revenue.
