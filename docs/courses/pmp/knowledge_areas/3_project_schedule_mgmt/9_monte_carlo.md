### üìä What is Monte Carlo Simulation in PMP?

In the context of **Project Management Professional (PMP)**, **Monte Carlo simulation** is a **quantitative risk analysis technique** used to understand the **impact of risk and uncertainty** on project objectives, such as **cost**, **schedule**, or **scope**.

---

### üîç Key Concept

Instead of using **single-point estimates** for task durations or costs, Monte Carlo simulation uses **ranges** and **probabilities**. It simulates the project **thousands of times** with different combinations of values to understand **all possible outcomes**.

---

### üß† How It Works (Simplified Steps)

1. **Input Uncertainties:**

   - Assign a **probability distribution** (e.g., normal, triangular, beta) to variables like task durations or costs.
   - Example for a task:

     - Optimistic = 4 days
     - Most Likely = 6 days
     - Pessimistic = 10 days

2. **Run Simulations:**

   - A computer randomly selects values from the input distributions for **each iteration**.
   - It might simulate **10,000 different project timelines**.

3. **Output Distribution:**

   - You get a **probability distribution** for total cost or schedule.
   - For example:

     - 80% chance project finishes in ‚â§ 35 days
     - 10% chance it exceeds 40 days

### üìà Output Example

Monte Carlo may produce charts such as:

- **Cumulative probability curves** (e.g., S-curves)
- **Histograms** showing cost or duration distributions

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits in PMP

- **Better forecasting** under uncertainty
- **Probabilistic decision-making** rather than deterministic
- Useful in:

  - **Schedule Risk Analysis**
  - **Cost Risk Analysis**
  - **Decision Tree Analysis**

- Helps define **confidence levels**:

  - E.g., "We are 90% confident this project will finish within 38 days."

### üß† PMP Exam Tip

Monte Carlo is a **Quantitative Risk Analysis** technique (not qualitative), and it **requires modeling of uncertainties** using **probability distributions** and **numerical simulations**.
