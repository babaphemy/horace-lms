### **Steps in Activity Sequencing**

1️⃣ **Define Activities** – List tasks required for completion.  
2️⃣ **Identify Dependencies** – Determine relationships between activities (Predecessor-Successor).  
3️⃣ **Sequence Activities** – Arrange them using logical relationships.  
4️⃣ **Determine Lead & Lag Times** – Define task overlaps or waiting periods.  
5️⃣ **Create a Network Diagram** – Visualize dependencies using flow charts or Gantt charts.  
6️⃣ **Validate & Optimize Sequence** – Ensure alignment with project scope and constraints.

📌 **Example: Activity Sequencing for Web Application Deployment**

🔹 **Task 1:** Design UI Components (**No dependencies**)  
🔹 **Task 2:** Develop API **(Depends on UI completion)**  
🔹 **Task 3:** Implement Security **(Depends on API being ready)**  
🔹 **Task 4:** Deploy Infrastructure **(Depends on security being configured)**

### **Dependency Types in Activity Sequencing**

| **Dependency Type**       | **Definition**                            | **Example**                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Finish-to-Start (FS)**  | A task must finish before the next starts | API setup must finish before security implementation             |
| **Start-to-Start (SS)**   | Two tasks begin at the same time          | UI design and API documentation start together                   |
| **Finish-to-Finish (FF)** | Two tasks must finish at the same time    | Database indexing and backend development must complete together |
| **Start-to-Finish (SF)**  | A task begins before another finishes     | Monitoring setup starts before deployment finishes               |

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Finish-to-Start (FS)**  | Task B cannot start until Task A finishes  | API development cannot start before UI design is completed   |
| **Start-to-Start (SS)**   | Task B starts at the same time as Task A   | UI testing starts alongside API setup                        |
| **Finish-to-Finish (FF)** | Task B finishes at the same time as Task A | Backend API coding and database indexing both end together   |
| **Start-to-Finish (SF)**  | Task B must start before Task A finishes   | Server monitoring begins before full deployment is completed |

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Start] --> B[UI Design]
  B --> C[Backend Development]
  C --> D[Security Setup]
  D --> E[Deployment]
  E --> F[Project Completion]
```

💡 This visual **maps task dependencies in sequential order**.
