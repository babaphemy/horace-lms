### **Milestone in Project Management**

A **milestone** is a **significant point or event** in a project timeline that marks **progress or completion of a critical phase**. Unlike regular tasks, milestones have **no duration**—they serve as checkpoints to monitor key achievements.

📌 **Example:**  
🔹 "Completion of OAuth authentication integration."  
🔹 "Approval of database schema design."  
🔹 "Deployment of the first production release."
