### **Rolling Wave Planning in Project Management**

**Rolling Wave Planning** is an **adaptive scheduling technique** that involves **progressively elaborating** project details as more information becomes available. Instead of defining all tasks upfront, teams **plan near-term work in detail** while leaving **future tasks less defined** until they approach execution.

### **Why Is Rolling Wave Planning Necessary?**

✅ **Improves Flexibility** – Adjusts plans based on evolving requirements.  
✅ **Enhances Accuracy** – Ensures detailed planning only when information is clear.  
✅ **Optimizes Resource Allocation** – Prevents premature commitment of resources.  
✅ **Supports Agile & Uncertain Projects** – Helps manage dynamic project environments.

### **Knowledge Area in PMBOK Guide**

Rolling Wave Planning belongs to **Project Schedule Management** and interacts with:  
🔹 **Scope Management** – Defining work as requirements become clearer.  
🔹 **Risk Management** – Mitigating uncertainty in long-term scheduling.  
🔹 **Integration Management** – Aligning iterative planning with project execution.

### **How Rolling Wave Planning Works**

1️⃣ **Immediate Tasks (Near-Term Work)** – Planned in detail for execution.  
2️⃣ **Upcoming Phases (Mid-Term Work)** – Outlined but not deeply detailed yet.  
3️⃣ **Future Tasks (Long-Term Work)** – Left broadly defined until more information is available.

📌 **Example: Rolling Wave Planning in a Web Application Deployment**

🔹 **Near-Term (Weeks 1-3)** → Develop UI components in **Next.js**.  
🔹 **Mid-Term (Weeks 4-6)** → Configure **OAuth authentication** after UI completion.  
🔹 **Long-Term (Weeks 7+)** → Scale infrastructure with **NGINX & Kubernetes**, refined closer to execution.

### **Likely PMP Certification Exam Question**

📌 **Which statement best describes Rolling Wave Planning?**  
A) It defines all project details upfront to prevent scope changes.  
B) It progressively elaborates work as information becomes clearer.  
C) It requires strict adherence to a pre-established project schedule.  
D) It prevents teams from planning tasks until the final phase.

💡 **Correct Answer:** **B) It progressively elaborates work as information becomes clearer.**

Since you're refining **scope management and Agile methodologies**, applying **Rolling Wave Planning** will help **balance flexibility with structured execution**.
