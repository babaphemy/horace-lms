### **Float in PMP (Project Schedule Management)**

**Float** (also known as **slack**) refers to the amount of time a task **can be delayed** without impacting the project’s overall completion. It helps project managers optimize scheduling and **allocate resources efficiently**.

### **Types of Float in Project Management**

| **Float Type**    | **Definition**                                                                  | **Impact on Schedule**                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Total Float**   | Time a task can be delayed **without affecting the project end date**           | Impacts overall timeline                   |
| **Free Float**    | Time a task can be delayed **without delaying its immediate successor**         | Only affects dependent tasks               |
| **Project Float** | Time the **entire project** can be delayed without affecting external deadlines | Impacts contract or regulatory commitments |

🔹 **Critical Path activities have zero float** – delaying them directly extends the project schedule.

### **Formula to Calculate Total Float**

📌 **Total Float Formula:**

```plaintext
Total Float = Late Start (LS) – Early Start (ES)
OR
Total Float = Late Finish (LF) – Early Finish (EF)
```

🔹 **LS & LF:** Latest possible time an activity can begin or end **without impacting the project deadline**.  
🔹 **ES & EF:** Earliest possible time an activity can begin or end **without disrupting predecessors**.

---

### **Example: Calculating Total Float**

📌 **Task Details**  
✔ **Early Start (ES) = Day 5**  
✔ **Late Start (LS) = Day 8**  
✔ **Early Finish (EF) = Day 10**  
✔ **Late Finish (LF) = Day 13**

📌 **Using Formula:**  
✅ **Total Float = LS – ES** → **8 – 5 = 3 days**  
✅ **OR Total Float = LF – EF** → **13 – 10 = 3 days**

✔ This means the task **can be delayed by 3 days** without affecting the project deadline!

### **Critical Path & Float Relationship**

🔹 **Tasks on the Critical Path** **(float = 0)** must be completed **on time**.  
🔹 **Non-critical tasks** may have **float**, allowing flexibility in scheduling.  
🔹 **High float values** indicate **low urgency**, while **zero float** signals **high priority** tasks.

### **Likely PMP Certification Exam Question**

📌 **What does zero total float indicate in a project schedule?**  
A) The task can be delayed without affecting the project deadline.  
B) The task must be completed on time to prevent delays.  
C) The project has extra buffer time for schedule adjustments.  
D) The task is not part of the critical path.

💡 **Correct Answer:** **B) The task must be completed on time to prevent delays.**

### **2. Activity Float Calculation Table**

| **Activity ID** | **Task Name**   | **Early Start (ES)** | **Late Start (LS)** | **Early Finish (EF)** | **Late Finish (LF)** | **Total Float (TF)** | **Free Float (FF)** |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| A1              | UI Design       | Day 1                | Day 1               | Day 10                | Day 12               | 2 Days               | 2 Days              |
| A2              | API Development | Day 11               | Day 13              | Day 22                | Day 24               | 2 Days               | 0 Days              |
| A3              | Security Setup  | Day 23               | Day 23              | Day 28                | Day 30               | 2 Days               | 2 Days              |

🔹 **Total Float (TF) = LS - ES OR LF - EF** → Determines how much a task can be delayed **without affecting the project end date**.  
🔹 **Free Float (FF) = Earliest successor ES - Current task EF** → Shows delay tolerance **without affecting the next activity**.

### **3. Critical Path Analysis**

✅ **Tasks with zero float are on the Critical Path** → Must be completed on time!  
✅ **Tasks with float offer scheduling flexibility** → Can be adjusted based on resource availability.  
✅ **Late Start & Late Finish dates help define buffer time** without project extension.

### Hands-on

Revert to 12_find_float.pdf for the question.

Let's answer each part based on the diagram and data from the PDF you uploaded.

---

### ✅ **1. Identify the Critical Path**

To find the **critical path**, we look for the longest duration path through the project. From the diagram:

- **ADGJ = 14**
- **BEGJ = 18**
- **BEH = 17**
- **CFIH = 20** ← 🔴 Longest → **Critical Path**
- **CFIK = 17**

➡️ **Critical Path = CFIH** with **duration = 20 days**

---

### ✅ **2. Complete the Forward Pass**

The forward pass calculates the **Earliest Start (ES)** and **Earliest Finish (EF)** for each activity.

From the PDF:

Example format:

```
Activity
ES  Duration  EF
```

For **Activity C**:
`ES = 1`, `Duration = 4`, `EF = 4` → `C: 1 4 4`
For **Activity F**:
`ES = 5`, `Duration = 5`, `EF = 9` → `F: 5 5 9`
... and so on.

➡️ **Forward pass is completed in the third chart from top in your PDF** (activities show values like `1 3 3`, etc.).

---

### ✅ **3. Complete the Backward Pass**

The backward pass calculates the **Latest Start (LS)** and **Latest Finish (LF)** for each activity. It proceeds from the end node backward.

Example format:

```
Activity
LS  Float  LF
```

For **Activity H**:
`LS = 17`, `LF = 20`, `Float = 0` → on critical path
For **Activity K**:
`LS = 20`, `LF = 20`, `Float = 3`

➡️ **Backward pass is completed in the fourth chart from top** in your PDF.

---

### ✅ **4. Expose the Float on a Given Activity**

**Float** = `LS - ES` (or `LF - EF`)

You can read this from the same fourth chart:

- E.g., **Activity K**:
  `ES = 17`, `EF = 17`, `LS = 20`, `LF = 20`
  ⇒ Float = `LS - ES = 3`

➡️ Activities on the **critical path have Float = 0**

---

### ❓ **Questions**

#### Q1. **Which path is the critical path?**

✅ **Answer: CFIH**, with **duration = 20 days**
Explanation: It's the longest path in terms of total duration and has **zero float** on all activities.

---

#### Q2. **If Activity B is delayed two days, how much can Activity G be delayed?**

To solve this, we look at:

- Path **BEGJ**: Duration = 18
- Path **CFIH** (critical path): Duration = 20

If **Activity B is delayed by 2 days**, path **BEGJ** becomes **20 days**, tying the critical path.

Now, **Activity G** in **BEGJ** has:

- **Float = 2** (from backward pass: ES = 14, LS = 16)

So:

- Originally, G could be delayed by 2 days without impacting the project.
- But **if B is delayed by 2 days**, the BEGJ path becomes **critical**.
- In that case, **Activity G has 0 float**, and **any delay** in G **will delay the project**.

✅ **Answer: If B is delayed by 2 days, G can’t be delayed at all without delaying the project.**
