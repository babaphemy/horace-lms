### **Objectives of Schedule Control**

‚úÖ **Track Progress** ‚Äì Compare actual task completion against the planned schedule.  
‚úÖ **Identify Variances** ‚Äì Detect schedule deviations and delays.  
‚úÖ **Adjust Timeline** ‚Äì Implement corrective actions when tasks fall behind.  
‚úÖ **Optimize Resources** ‚Äì Reallocate resources to avoid bottlenecks.  
‚úÖ **Minimize Risks** ‚Äì Address scheduling risks early to prevent disruptions.

### **Schedule Control Techniques**

| **Technique**              | **Purpose**                                                         | **Example Use Case**                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance Reviews**    | Compare planned vs. actual progress                                 | Sprint review meetings in Agile                           |
| **Critical Path Analysis** | Identify tasks affecting project completion                         | Detect delays in API development                          |
| **Schedule Compression**   | Recover lost time using **Fast Tracking** or **Crashing**           | Overlap UI design and backend setup to speed up execution |
| **Variance Analysis**      | Measure schedule deviations using **Earned Value Management (EVM)** | Check Planned vs. Actual Schedule Performance Index (SPI) |
| **Rolling Wave Planning**  | Adjust near-term activities while refining future tasks             | Refining deployment strategies for scalability            |

üìå **Example:** If a project is **5 days behind schedule**, the team may use **Fast Tracking** (executing tasks in parallel) or **Crashing** (adding extra resources) to recover lost time.
