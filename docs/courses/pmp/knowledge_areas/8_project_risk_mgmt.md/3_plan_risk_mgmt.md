# **Risk Plan Management in PMP**

🔹 **Risk Plan Management** is the process of **defining how risks will be identified, analyzed, responded to, and controlled** throughout the project lifecycle.  
🔹 It ensures **proactive risk management**, minimizing negative impacts and maximizing opportunities.

---

## **1️⃣ Plan Risk Management**

📌 **Defines how key stakeholders will:**

✅ **Identify Risks** – Use brainstorming, expert judgment, and historical data to recognize potential threats.  
✅ **Analyze Risks** – Assess probability, impact, and prioritization using qualitative and quantitative methods.  
✅ **Create Risk Responses** – Develop mitigation, avoidance, transfer, or acceptance strategies.  
✅ **Control Risks** – Continuously monitor risks and adjust responses as needed.

📌 **Example:**  
✔ A project manager **conducts a risk planning workshop** to document **potential delays, budget overruns, and resource shortages**.

---

## **2️⃣ Stakeholder Risk Exposure and Tolerance**
