### **Work Performance Data (WPD) in PMP**

**Work Performance Data (WPD)** refers to the raw, unprocessed information collected during the execution of project activities. It serves as the foundation for assessing project status and making informed decisions.

### **Key Characteristics of Work Performance Data**

- **Real-time and Objective:** Direct observations or recorded values during project execution.
- **Collected from Various Processes:** Data from different project aspects such as scheduling, cost, risks, and resources.
- **Basis for Analysis:** Used to derive insights that influence project decisions.

### **Examples of Work Performance Data**

- **Project Schedule:** Actual start and end dates of tasks vs. planned schedules.
- **Cost Data:** Expenses incurred against the budget.
- **Resource Usage:** Logged working hours of team members.
- **Defect Counts:** Number of issues identified during testing phases.
- **Risk Events:** Tracked occurrences of identified risks.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Comments and reports from project stakeholders.

### **Knowledge Area in PMBOK Guide**

Work Performance Data belongs to the **Project Integration Management** knowledge area. It is primarily generated during **Monitoring and Controlling** processes, helping project managers track progress and make adjustments.

Additionally, WPD interacts with several other knowledge areas:

- **Scope Management:** Tracks completed deliverables.
- **Schedule Management:** Captures task durations and milestone achievements.
- **Cost Management:** Records actual spending vs. planned budget.
- **Quality Management:** Collects data on defect rates and compliance with standards.
- **Risk Management:** Logs risk occurrences and their impact on project execution.

### **Example of WPD Usage in Decision-Making**

#### **Scenario: Software Development Project Using CI/CD**

A development team is building a web application using **Next.js and NGINX**. As they deploy updates, the project manager collects the following WPD:

1. **Deployment Success Rate:** 95% successful deployments, 5% rollbacks due to errors.
2. **Testing Data:** Automated test failures in 10% of builds.
3. **Performance Metrics:** Load time increased by 20% after the latest deployment.
4. **Resource Utilization:** Developer contributions based on Git commits.

Using this WPD, the project manager:

- Identifies a performance drop and assigns optimization tasks.
- Investigates common errors leading to rollback failures.
- Adjusts resources to improve efficiency in debugging.

Work Performance Data serves as the raw input that drives **Work Performance Information (WPI)**, which is later processed to produce **Work Performance Reports (WPR)** for stakeholder decision-making.
