### ✅ What is **Earned Value Management (EVM)** in PMP?

**Earned Value Management (EVM)** is a **project performance measurement technique** used to evaluate and control project progress by integrating:

- **Scope**
- **Schedule**
- **Cost**

It helps determine **how much work has actually been accomplished** compared to what was planned and how much it cost to do that work.

### 📊 Key EVM Metrics:

| Metric                               | Meaning                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Planned Value (PV)**               | Budgeted cost of work scheduled (baseline plan) |
| **Earned Value (EV)**                | Budgeted cost of work actually completed        |
| **Actual Cost (AC)**                 | Actual cost incurred for the work performed     |
| **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**     | EV / AC → Cost efficiency                       |
| **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)** | EV / PV → Schedule efficiency                   |
| **Estimate at Completion (EAC)**     | Projected total cost at completion              |

### 📍 When is EVM Used?

**EVM is used during the**:

### 👉 **Monitor and Control Project Work** process group.

This is the phase where you:

- Track project performance
- Compare actual work to planned work
- Identify variances
- Predict future performance
- Make informed decisions to get back on track

---

### 🚀 Why Use EVM?

- Provides **objective performance data**
- Enables **early detection** of problems
- Helps in **forecasting** cost and time outcomes
- Supports **informed decision-making**

> ✅ PMP encourages using EVM especially for **complex or high-budget projects** to improve control and predictability.
