  The **Project Management Plan (PMP)** is a comprehensive document that outlines how a project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. It integrates subsidiary plans related to scope, schedule, cost, quality, resource management, risk, procurement, and stakeholder engagement. Essentially, it serves as a roadmap for managing the project effectively.

### **Knowledge Area**

The Project Management Plan falls under the **Project Integration Management** knowledge area in the **PMBOK Guide**. This knowledge area is crucial because it ensures coordination among different aspects of the project to achieve its objectives.

### **Relationship to Project Charter**

The **Project Charter** formally authorizes the existence of the project and provides high-level information, such as objectives, constraints, stakeholders, and assigned project manager. The **Project Management Plan**, on the other hand, is developed after the charter and contains detailed planning elements. It expands on the charter by defining how the project will be managed and executed.
