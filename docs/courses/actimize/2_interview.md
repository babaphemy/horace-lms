### Q: Describe your experience with Nice¬†Actimize¬†such as SAM, AIS, RCM, Actone?

**"Over the past 10 years, I‚Äôve had extensive hands-on experience across the core components of the NICE Actimize ecosystem ‚Äî including SAM, AIS, RCM, and ActOne ‚Äî delivering enterprise-grade financial crime and compliance solutions for Tier 1 banks and financial institutions."**

### üß† **SAM (Suspicious Activity Monitoring):**

I‚Äôve worked extensively with SAM, both on out-of-the-box models and on customized detection logic. My responsibilities included:

- Developing custom detection rules using the Actimize Policy Manager.
- Tuning thresholds and segmentations to reduce false positives.
- Managing UDM (Unified Data Model) mappings to align source feeds with detection logic.
- Collaborating with compliance teams to define risk typologies and regulatory mappings.
- Implementing post-processing logic and model enhancements for better coverage.

I also participated in SAM upgrades and performance tuning, including optimizing model execution and data feeds for large-scale deployments.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **AIS (Actimize Intelligence Server):**

AIS has been the backbone for my detection logic deployments. My key tasks included:

- Developing and deploying custom AIS packages (XML rule packages).
- Utilizing the AIS Console for validation and debugging of detection logic.
- Performing UDM mappings via the UDM Mapper and validating inputs through the AIS simulator.
- Managing multiple environments (DEV, QA, UAT, PROD) and ensuring consistency in logic deployment using SVN and Jenkins CI/CD.

### üìÇ **RCM (Risk Case Manager):**

I‚Äôve developed and customized RCM extensively for case management workflows:

- Designed and implemented custom workflows and alerts.
- Created enrichment plugins and data loaders to enhance alert data.
- Integrated RCM with external KYC and Customer Master systems for additional case context.
- Built audit trail capabilities and compliance dashboards using RCM reports.
- Tuned auto-assignment rules and prioritization logic to align with business SLAs.

### üìå **ActOne:**

With the migration of several clients from legacy RCM to ActOne, I‚Äôve supported:

- Migration of custom workflows and alert processing rules from RCM to ActOne.
- Designing UI customizations using ActOne‚Äôs microservice-based architecture.
- Working with ActOne Studio to configure widgets, tasks, and entities.
- Integration with external systems like screening (WL/PEP), case resolution APIs, and internal audit tracking.

I also ensured that all ActOne deployments followed client-specific governance, security, and DevOps practices.

### ‚úÖ Summary:

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve focused on delivering highly customized, performant, and regulator-ready Actimize solutions ‚Äî always with a focus on scalability, auditability, and risk reduction. I‚Äôve also mentored junior developers, written SOPs, and led multiple client implementations from design through to post-go-live support.
