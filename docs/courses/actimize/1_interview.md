## ðŸ“‹ Sample Interview Questions & How to Answer

**1. What is IFM and how does it work in real time?**  
IFM monitors transactions in real time by ingesting data into the UDM. It applies detection models built using rules, analytics, or machine learning. When a transaction violates thresholds or matches fraud patterns, an alert is generated and routed to RCM.

**2. How do you customize detection logic in Actimize?**  
Using the Actimize Policy Manager and Modeler, I create custom logic based on business requirements. This may include writing rules, threshold logic, or even Java custom logic. Iâ€™ve also worked with scorecards to combine various indicators for risk scoring.

**3. Describe your experience with RCM.**  
RCM is the workflow and case management module. Iâ€™ve configured alert queues, routing logic, escalation paths, and roles. Iâ€™ve also customized case views and integrated external systems via AIS or REST APIs.

**4. How do you ingest data into Actimize?**  
Through ETL processes or using AIS. Iâ€™ve developed jobs that map incoming data to the UDM schema. Ensuring data quality and completeness is essential for accurate detection.

**5. What challenges have you faced in implementing IFM?**  
One challenge was optimizing real-time performance under high load. I worked with the infrastructure team to tune JVM settings, database indexing, and rules to improve throughput. I also resolved issues related to incorrect UDM mappings and data delays.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for the Interview

- Prepare use cases showing measurable fraud reduction or system performance gains.
- Talk about collaboration with fraud analysts and compliance teams.
- Know how to articulate risk-based alerting and how false positives are minimized.
- Brush up on current fraud trends (e.g., APP scams, synthetic identity fraud).
- Review integration with third-party systems (e.g., core banking, KYC providers).

## ðŸ§  Scenario-Based Question Example

**Q:** A bank is seeing a rise in mobile banking fraud. How would you enhance their IFM solution to catch these activities?

**A:**

- Analyze historical fraud data for patterns (e.g., login location, device changes, fund transfer patterns).
- Update UDM to ensure all mobile events are captured (login, transfers, device registration).
- Create or adjust detection models targeting anomalies in mobile behaviors.
- Tune thresholds based on fraud analyst feedback.
- Enable real-time alerts and route them to the appropriate RCM queue.
