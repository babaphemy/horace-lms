# Q:

## Describe your experience with installation and configuration of customized solutions for the¬†Actimize¬†product within SAM, RCM, AIS, etc?

**"Over the past 10 years, I‚Äôve been directly involved in the installation, environment setup, and configuration of customized Actimize solutions across key modules ‚Äî including SAM (Suspicious Activity Monitoring), RCM (Risk Case Manager), AIS (Actimize Intelligence Server), and most recently, ActOne. My experience spans both greenfield implementations and upgrades, with a heavy focus on tailoring Actimize to specific client needs."**

### üß∞ **Installation & Environment Configuration**

#### ‚úÖ **Infrastructure & Deployment:**

- Installed and configured Actimize components on both **on-premise** and **cloud-hosted** (private cloud / hybrid) environments.
- Set up multi-node AIS and RCM clusters, ensuring high availability, load balancing, and optimized performance.
- Managed WebLogic / Tomcat servers, Oracle/MS SQL backends, and ensured integration with Active Directory or LDAP for SSO.

#### ‚úÖ **Environment Management:**

- Built and maintained environments (DEV, QA, UAT, PROD) with version control across all AIS rule packages and RCM workflows.
- Automated deployments using Jenkins and Ansible for consistency and rollback support.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Customization Experience**

#### üîπ **SAM:**

- Customized detection models using **Actimize Modeler** ‚Äî from rule logic to scenario configurations.
- Tuned segmentation, thresholds, and scoring logic based on client-specific risk appetite.
- Integrated with client-specific transaction feeds ‚Äî such as custom core banking systems, payment rails, and card systems ‚Äî and mapped fields into **UDM**.

#### üîπ **AIS:**

- Deployed and managed custom-built AIS packages, including logic-based alerts and entity linkages.
- Configured **UDM Mapper** and validated mappings through the AIS Console.
- Built custom batch jobs and logic chains tailored to detection requirements.

#### üîπ **RCM:**

- Installed and customized RCM workflows including alert routing rules, case escalation paths, and investigator views.
- Developed **custom plugins** (Java-based) for data enrichment, dynamic routing, and external system integration (e.g., KYC, transaction viewers).
- Customized XML-based alert layouts and notification templates to align with client compliance policies.

---

### üîÅ **Ongoing Support & Optimization**

- Implemented **alert volume controls**, **auto-closure rules**, and **rule hit explainability** features.
- Regularly reviewed system logs, optimized detection performance, and resolved production issues across modules.
- Worked closely with Actimize support during major version upgrades and hotfix rollouts.

---

### ‚úÖ **Business Impact:**

- My configurations have helped reduce false positives, improve investigator efficiency, and increase alert precision.
- In several projects, I also trained compliance teams on the custom modules, created technical SOPs, and ensured alignment with regulatory reporting needs (e.g., SAR, STR filing logic).
