# Q How have you utilized¬†Actimize¬†Modeler to develop from-scratch modules to track and alert Fraud or Anti-Money Laundering activities?

Certainly! Here's a strong and specific answer tailored for a senior Actimize developer with real-world experience using **Actimize Modeler** to build AML or fraud detection modules from scratch:

---

**"I‚Äôve used Actimize Modeler extensively to build custom detection modules from scratch, particularly for specialized Fraud and AML scenarios that were not fully covered by standard out-of-the-box models. My role spanned the full lifecycle ‚Äî from initial business requirement gathering through to deployment and tuning in production."**

### üîß **Key Steps and Contributions Using Actimize Modeler:**

#### 1. **Requirements Gathering & Use Case Design**

- Collaborated closely with compliance and fraud teams to understand the typologies ‚Äî such as structuring, transaction laundering, mule accounts, or first-party fraud.
- Translated regulatory and investigative needs into concrete detection objectives and model criteria.

#### 2. **Data Integration & UDM Mapping**

- Defined required fields and sourced data via ETL into the Actimize UDM schema.
- Used **UDM Mapper** to link source data fields to UDM-compliant fields, ensuring consistency and completeness.

#### 3. **Model Development in Actimize Modeler**

- Built **scenarios** using Actimize Modeler with logic blocks, expressions, and filters tailored to the fraud/AML typology.
- Applied **real-time** and **batch logic** where appropriate ‚Äî for instance, real-time on login anomalies or batch on daily wire transfer analysis.
- Implemented **risk scoring logic**, segmentation strategies, and threshold-based alert generation.

#### 4. **Validation and Testing**

- Used the **AIS Console** to simulate and validate data inputs, thresholds, and alert generation logic.
- Ran **UAT** with anonymized production data to benchmark hit rates and false positives before go-live.

#### 5. **Deployment & Ongoing Tuning**

- Packaged and deployed the models via AIS across environments (DEV ‚Üí QA ‚Üí PROD).
- Tuned model parameters post-deployment based on investigator feedback and alert performance.
- Implemented monitoring to ensure model health and performance over time.

### üß† Examples of Custom Modules Built:

- A high-risk account behavior module that looked for sudden velocity changes in account usage.
- A fraud detection model for card-not-present (CNP) ecommerce fraud patterns, leveraging merchant, IP, and time-based segmentation.
- A cross-channel AML model that correlated wire, ACH, and cash transactions to detect layering patterns.

### üèÅ Final Result:

These from-scratch models helped reduce false positives, improve detection of emerging threats, and provide more actionable alerts to investigation teams. They were built with scalability in mind and integrated seamlessly with RCM/ActOne for case handling.
